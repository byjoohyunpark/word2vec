# word2vec
This repo is for using [word2vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec) to get symmetric relationship between words in vectors space. We can choose the layer of output dimension, but here is set to 2-dimension for using in my thesis project (Unknown Universe) in part. All content of here refers to [Yuli Cai](https://www.caiyuli.com/)'s beautiful methodology for her project [Word Land](https://github.com/yulicai/Word-Land). You can check details at her repo.
